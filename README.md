# 3 Year Inventory Analysis

The 3 year inventory analysis is done based on an eCommerce database provided by [Paul Scotchford](https://github.com/FedoAIworld/3-Year-Inventory-Analysis/blob/main/eCommerce.bak). 

# Dashboards

Two dashboards are created from the SQL queries.

- Dashboard 1: [Stock Performance](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/fernand.b.eloundou/viz/3YearInventoryAnalysis-StockPerformance/StockPerformance)
- Dashboard 2: [Overstock Performance](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/fernand.b.eloundou/viz/3YearInventoryAnalysis-OverstockPerformance/OverstockPerformance)
